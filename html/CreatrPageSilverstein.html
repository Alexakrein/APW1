		<h2>Welcome to Archie's Project Page</h2>
		<h4>As a first-year student in advanced Programming I wasn't assigned any work on the main project's page. I learned some HTML from doing all of this</h4>
		<h4>The project Jacob and I will be working on is called Creatr:  Creatr will be an online platform for long-distance collaboration, with a built-in project management system and educational resources. You might be thinking about all the things that Creatr is similar to. Github? Topcoder? Maybe Instructables? The truth is, nobody has made anything quite like Creatr, a platform not just for sharing projects, but for making them. From its inception, each project on our site comes with achievable milestones, from which the project manager can measure the growth of the project.</h4>

		<br>
		<h4 id="dates">12/11/20</h4>
		<li>I started doing my project by familiarizing myself with HTML. I did so by taking four codecademy Exercises in HTML. I stopped taking the courses because I felt confident enough in my knowledge of the program to get myself started on my project.</li>
		<h6>*Sorry that I did not include this at the time. I'm putting this update after the fact because this is the progress that I made last month*</h6>
		<br>
		<h4 id="dates">12/18/20</h4>
		<li>At this point I was fairly busy writing my college supplements. I had not heard back from my Early Decision school yet and I was writing my Regular Decision Supplements, preparing for the winter break work that (thankfully) I didn't have to finish. Once again, I'm sorry for not completing the assignment when it was due.</li>
		<br>
		<h4 id="dates">1/8/21</h4>
		<li>Recently, I have been following a tutorial from an incredible coder who is building a mock version of Facebook called myBook. The subjects and concepts that he's been covering are exactly the kind of aspects I need to know for Jacob and my project. I am currently working my way throughg his tutorials. I am roughly a quarter or third of the way through his lengthy tutorial (here is the link if you would like to check it out: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeOhsHkMaKQ&list=PLY3j36HMSHNWaKUC73RJlwi6oU-WTpTPM&index=1&ab_channel=QuickProgramming" target="_blank" rel="noopener nonreferrer">Social Website From Scratch</a>. It's teaching me a lot of good HTML, and it recently started teaching me about XAMPP. I have worked a bit on my main project, but I'm still building up the tools to do so in an effective way, and I project to be done with the tutorial soon.

		<h5>I hope I have done enough work. Please let me know if I should be working more, and if you have any recommendations of things I could be doing differently, (or just general design tips about my personal page) please let me know when you get the chance! Thank you! Have a great day!</h5>
