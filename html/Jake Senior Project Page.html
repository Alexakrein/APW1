			<h7> 11/19/2020: I have been experimenting with VBA in excel. I have learned the basics on how to set up a module and create macros.</h7>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h7> 12/9/2020: I have writen some code for my ardino and now I am just waiting for my cables to arrive from amazon so I can attach the servo. I did test the ardino and got the blinking light to work. I also have been working on my teachback presentation and have been creating some VBA explains to explain why VBA is just a bad language</h7>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h7> 12/16/2020: This entire week was spent preparing a presentation for my teachback. I made a couple examples for class and wrote a general outline for a script.</h7>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h7> 1/7/2021: This is my first project using ardinos so I have been trying to do some background research to understand all the parts. Today in class I watched a series of youtube videos on the each part of the board and how each peice can be used. Honestly, it has been very helpful because even though I worked with a raspberry pi last year up to this point I have not understood the parts of the hardware.</h7>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h7> 1/15/2021: This week I wrote some code that is supposed to make my servos spin at certain intervals but this week was challenging because I left my hardware in Massachusetts. I created several snipets that should make the servo spin at certain intervals so that when I hook a stylus it will run the macro on my screen probably. It will probaly have to be tweaked but that is a next week project.</h7>
