<p style="background-blend-mode: color-burn;" style="text-align:center;">
For my independent project, I am going to work on Brilliant courses, and hopefully give a teachback on what I've learned. First I am going to start with Logic courses 1, 2 and then Joy of Problem solving. I think that these will be useful for coding, helping me look at programming more logically, and giving myself the courage to problem solve when hit with a road block. I will take that knowledge into actual programming courses such as, Computer Science Fundamentals, Algorithm Fundamentals and Programming with Python. If complete all of these and have time for a second project, I would like to learn website design. Will add more details when I come closer to it.

<h3>Another logic puzzle for you to solve.</h3>
<h4>Rules become a bit more complex</h4>
<h5>Futoshiki is a board-based puzzle game, also known under the name Unequal. It is playable on a square board having a given fixed size (4x4 for example).

The purpose of the game is to discover the digits hidden inside the board's cells; each cell is filled with a digit between 1 and the board's size. On each row and column each digit appears exactly once; therefore, when revealed, the digits of the board form a so-called Latin square.

At the beginning of the game some digits might be revealed. The board might also contain some inequalities between the board cells; these inequalities must be respected and can be used as clues in order to discover the remaining hidden digits.

Each puzzle is guaranteed to have a solution and only one. Draw this one out on a piece of paper. *Hint* Stay organized</h5>
