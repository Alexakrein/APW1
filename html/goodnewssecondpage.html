<h2>November 2020 - Color Palette Generator</h2>

<p style="color:darkslateblue">My most recent project is a random color palette generator. I presented on it as well as the history of colors in the programming world. I used JavaScript as well as HTML to make the generator. It creates a randomly generated, non-coordinated palette of 5 different colors. To expand off of this, I will show the hex code each color is as it generates and maybe figure out a way to make the colors go together.</p>

<h2>June 2020 - Translator</h2>

<p style="color:darkslateblue">My project was a English to Spanish/Spanish to English translator in Python. I worked on this project with Leila last year. We used dictionary APIs from Merriam Webster to create a translator that will take a word in one language and translate it to the other language. As an expanding point from that, we would have started to try and make our translator translate whole sentences or phrases.</p>
