<h2>This is a Work in Progress</h2>

  (a) As you saw on the previous page, I made a basic game of tetris as my first APW project.
  The game is still a work in progress, but I am happy with what i was able to ccomplish so far.
  (b) I will most likely finish the Tetris before moving on, but my big project of the year will be to build an online version of Creatr, Archie's and
  My genius invention for a democratized maker solution. To accomplish this to a satifactory quality, we will need good web design, secure web structure,
  a really....attractive GUI, and maybe a domain. We will work on it and see.

<h4>
  Week ending Friday 1/08: Still hung up on the problem mentioned previously. New build of HTML and PHP suggests that the problem might not be with the PHP, but with the HTML form.
